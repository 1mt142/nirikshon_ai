_Figure 1: System Architecture Overview_

This system utilizes an HD camera and AI-powered object detection to identify harmful or unexpected objects in different environments using trained data models. It operates in two modes:

1. Household or Ground-Level Security:
   The system can detect threats such as intruders or even stray animals like dogs entering a restricted area (e.g., your home, backyard, or office premises). When a threat is identified through the camera, it captures an image and sends a real-time alert ‚Äî including the image ‚Äî to your WhatsApp or other preferred communication channels.

2. Sky Protection:
   For aerial threats, such as missiles or flying objects, the system uses the HD camera to perform real-time detection. Upon identifying a potential airborne threat, it captures the image and sends an alert. Following detection, a radar module is activated to continuously track the object‚Äôs movement in the sky, enabling enhanced surveillance and threat monitoring.

By combining AI with visual and radar-based tracking, the system ensures flexible protection for both ground-level and sky-based security threats.

### How It Works

1. **Detection**: The system continuously analyzes video feeds for objects using predefined detection models.
2. **Capture**: Once a object is detected, the system captures an image of the object.
3. **Notification**: The captured image is sent instantly to your WhatsApp via a pre-configured session.

### Setup

Ensure your detection model includes harmful objects and is properly configured. Set up WhatsApp Web integration as per the installation instructions.
